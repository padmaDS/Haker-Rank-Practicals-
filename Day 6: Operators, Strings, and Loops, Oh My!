Task
Given a string, , of length  that is indexed from  to , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note:  is considered to be an even index.

Example


Print abc def

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contain a string, .

Constraints

Output Format

For each String  (where ), print 's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.

Explanation

Test Case 0: 

The even indices are , , and , and the odd indices are , , and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().

Test Case 1: 

The even indices are  and , and the odd indices are  and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().

Solution:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

T = int(input().strip())

# loop over the test cases
for _ in range(T):
    # read a line of input
    S = input().strip()

    # initialize two string variables to store even and odd characters
    even_chars = ""
    odd_chars = ""

    # loop through the string and append even and odd characters to respective variables
    for i in range(len(S)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_chars += S[i]
        else:
            odd_chars += S[i]

    # print the even and odd characters with a space in between
    print(even_chars, odd_chars)
